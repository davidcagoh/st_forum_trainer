Forum: MSF’s review of Megan Khung case should look into empowering social workers,"UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","The media has been abuzz with reports on the tragic death of four-year-old Megan Khung, following a year of physical abuse in her home.
A report in The Straits Times (Megan Khung’s death: At least 7 other fatal child abuse cases in Singapore over past 10 years, April 8) cited seven other cases of fatal child abuse in the past 10 years, with the children’s ages ranging from two weeks to 11 years.
In Megan’s case, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) attributed the “inadequate” interventions by the social agencies involved to Megan’s pre-school report “not fully describing the severity of her injuries” (Info from Megan Khung’s pre-school gave no reason for ECDA to suspect girl’s abuse: MSF, April 8)
Media reports point to a collective failure of the system  and a series of lapses in the reporting of abuse and follow-up checks.
MSF has since said it will further review the case (MSF planning further review of Megan Khung’s case, covering responses of all parties, April 11).
This move should help restore public trust in our system to protect children.
I have three points to make regarding the review.
First, the review should examine not just the responses of the various social agencies per se. It should also investigate any underlying human or organisational factors that might have contributed to inadequacies of responses.
Second, because broader issues may be involved, MSF should invite representations, written or oral, from interested parties such as the Singapore Children’s Society (SCS), Children’s Aid Society and Society Against Family Violence. They would likely have observations, insights and suggestions to contribute. In fact, SCS has already made two recommendations relating to child protection in pre-schools   (Social workers say the system failed to protect Megan Khung; pre-school not solely responsible, April 10).
Third, I suggest that MSF also review whether social workers dealing with child abuse cases can be more empowered. For example, can lying to a social worker investigating a child abuse complaint be made an offence? Can a social worker be empowered to exercise discretion and make a 999 call for police assistance to enter a home to look for a child? An alternative would be to have a special police hotline for such calls.
MSF’s review should be a comprehensive one. No stone should be left unturned.

Forum: Time for an independent child fatality review panel to prevent more tragedies,"UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","The recent sentencing in Megan Khung’s case (Abuse, death of four-year-old girl: Mum jailed 19 years, boyfriend gets 30 years’ jail, 17 strokes, April 3) and the subsequent review of inter-agency processes (Info from Megan Khung’s pre-school gave no reason for ECDA to suspect girl’s abuse: MSF, April 8) have brought to light deep concerns for Singapore to reflect upon as a society.
The Singapore Children’s Society has rightly proposed stronger training and capacity-building initiatives, and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has implemented procedural improvements to strengthen the child protection system.
However, beyond improving detection and response mechanisms, Megan’s case highlights a more profound issue: the growing fear, sorrow and mistrust that tragic cases like hers leave in their wake – among the public, communities and even professionals tasked with protecting children.
When such tragedies occur, they shake confidence in the system and leave many painful questions unanswered. If we are to truly rebuild public trust and demonstrate that every effort is being made to learn from these fatal outcomes, Singapore must seriously consider establishing an independent child fatality review panel, legislated under the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA).
This panel would be empowered by law to:
Access records and information across agencies and professionals involved in a child’s life;
Conduct in-depth reviews of child fatality cases;
Identify systemic failures or missed opportunities for intervention;
Publish findings and recommendations to improve the child protection system; and
Monitor follow-up actions and compliance to proposed reforms.
Other countries have already taken this step. In the United States, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act  requires every state to have a child death review panel to identify preventable factors in child deaths and recommend strategies for systemic improvement. Closer to home, Hong Kong’s Child Fatality Review Panel systematically reviews child deaths, publishes reports, and provides accessible insights to the public.
A legislated panel must also be transparent – publishing its findings, acknowledging systemic lapses, and openly sharing lessons learnt.
Importantly, to ensure true transparency and public confidence, the panel must be made up of individuals who are impartial, independent of the agencies involved in the case, and free from any conflict of interest. This ensures objectivity and removes the risk of perceived bias in the review process.
Transparency not only fosters learning and improvement across agencies, but also assures the public that no death is ignored. It honours the child’s life and affirms that every child’s life matters. When a child dies, it is our moral responsibility to ensure that the tragedy is thoroughly examined and used to drive change.
Establishing such a panel would send a powerful signal of Singapore’s political and social commitment to child welfare and child rights. It would show that our society values every child’s life and is determined to learn and improve – fairly, consistently, and with integrity.
Since 2015, we have lost a number of children to fatal abuse. Out of them, at least eight were not known to social services at the point of their death.
These were not just statistics; they were lives that could have been saved. We owe it to Megan – and to the seven others – to do better. The time to act is now.
Singapore must take clear, legislative steps to implement structural change in how we review and learn from these tragedies. We can – and must – build a system where no child falls through the cracks again.

Forum: Community groups are key stakeholders in crisis response,"UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","We thank Ms Norhaiyah Mahmood for her letter “Beyond counter-terror drills, people have a vital role to play” (April 4), and her appreciation for the efforts of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Ministry of Defence.
We agree with Ms Norhaiyah that counter-terrorism and emergency preparedness are necessarily whole-of-society efforts.
Community groups are key stakeholders, and we are heartened that many have come forward to contribute.
Under the SGSecure national movement, MHA and the People’s Association work closely to engage community groups through platforms such as the Community Response Roundtables (CRRT). The CRRT comprises key representatives from schools, businesses, and grassroots, religious and other community organisations within a geographic area, to facilitate collaboration and preparedness against terror threats. Table-top and crisis response exercises are conducted for CRRT members. The exercises help them to prepare for emergencies, and support the community after an attack.
MHA also works with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth to engage community groups through the racial and religious harmony circles. The harmony circles have established strong rapport and familiarity with local community leaders. These networks facilitate the timely dissemination of information, and the restoration of confidence and trust between communities during crises. The harmony circles regularly participate in crisis response exercises, to prepare them to address any racial and religious tensions.
We thank our community and public sector partners for championing SGSecure to keep Singapore safe and secure.

"Forum: Hold vendors to same high cyber security standards, or they may become weakest link","UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","I read with concern the recent news that DBS and Bank of China (Singapore) customers had their personal data stolen in a ransomware attack targeting a printing vendor (More than 11,000 DBS, Bank of China customers’ information compromised after data attack on vendor, April 7).
While it is reassuring that customer accounts and login details were not compromised, this incident reminds us that cyber security is not only about protecting our own systems, but also about ensuring our partners do the same.
In this case, the breach did not happen within the banks themselves. It occurred at Toppan Next Tech, a third-party vendor tasked with printing customer letters and statements. The data stolen reportedly includes names, addresses, and in some cases, account information. Such data can be exploited in phishing attacks or identity theft, especially when combined with other online sources.
The banks were quick to clarify that their systems were unaffected, but as members of the public, we might ask: Shouldn’t the banks be responsible for ensuring their vendors are just as secure?
Many businesses today rely on external vendors for printing, cloud storage, or customer support. However, if these vendors are not held to the same cyber security standards, they may become the weakest link in the chain. In the cyber security industry, this is often referred to as “third-party risk”.
Cyberattacks are growing in both frequency and impact, and it is commendable that the Cyber Security Agency and Monetary Authority of Singapore are taking this incident seriously.
But moving forward, we must shift from a mindset of “reacting to incidents” to “preventing them through stronger oversight”, especially where customer data is involved.
Trust is hard-earned, and in the digital world, it’s built not just on what companies do themselves, but also on whom they choose to trust.

Forum: Holistic approach to assessing teleconsultation is key,"UPDATED APR 14, 2025, 05:00 AM","We thank Dr Wong Tien Hua for sharing his views (Ultra-short teleconsultations can’t ensure quality of medical care, April 8).
MaNaDr agrees fully that the quality of teleconsultations must be determined holistically and always in the best interest of patients, and not just by duration.
The one-minute timer we introduced on the platform serves as a starting point and a guide; it is not an endorsement or recommendation that one minute is the right length of time for a consultation.
As Dr Wong has noted, there are instances where a consultation will need to run longer, and conversely, in some other cases such as more straightforward follow-ups, there is no need for an overly long consultation. Still, this guard rail – one of many we have implemented – is a clear reminder to doctors of their responsibility to put patients first. 
We will keep engaging with our stakeholders to collectively uphold a safe, ethical and effective platform for digital care, and welcome Dr Wong to further talk with us to continue this important conversation on the future of healthcare in Singapore.

"Forum: Fire safety a personal responsibility, not just that of the authorities","UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","My deepest condolences to the family of the 10-year-old girl who died in the River Valley Road fire (10-year-old girl dies after fire breaks out at River Valley Road shophouse, April 8).
After the fire occurred, many questioned the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the building’s owner over alleged lapses in fire safety. But are they solely responsible?
During my travels across Europe, the US, Japan and Canada, I’ve seen many beautiful wooden houses – some built closely together and many featuring open fireplaces.
A building engineer once told me that such structures are considered fire hazards in Singapore and would not be approved by BCA. It’s curious that other First World countries allow them, yet severe house fires are relatively rare.
So, what makes the difference?
In these countries, residents do not play with fire – literally and figuratively. They are deeply conscious of fire risks and take personal responsibility for fire prevention.
Fire safety is not just a regulation; it’s a mindset. Unfortunately, in Singapore, many of us tend to rely solely on the authorities for safety and do not actively cultivate fire awareness as part of our daily lives.
We must ask ourselves if we are doing our part.
Fire safety should not be an afterthought or outsourced responsibility. It should be a shared commitment – starting with our homes, workplaces, schools and communities. We need to educate our children, check our fire exits, test our alarms, and stay vigilant.
Rather than questioning SCDF or BCA, we must also look inward. Fire safety is not just the job of the authorities – it’s a personal responsibility. Let’s take ownership, because when it comes to fire, prevention is the best protection.

Forum: Urgent need to step up fire prevention measures,"UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","The National Safety Council of Singapore is deeply concerned over the increasing number of fire incidents occurring in apartments and buildings across Singapore. These result not only in damage to property, but also in the loss of precious lives.
The recent fire in River Valley Road, where a 10-year-old girl tragically lost her life, is a heartbreaking reminder of the devastating consequences of such incidents (10-year-old girl dies after fire breaks out at River Valley Road shophouse, April 8).
In the past few years, Singapore has also seen other serious incidents, such as the fire in a Bedok North flat that claimed three lives, and a blaze in Yishun which left several residents injured and displaced.
These incidents point to a worrying trend that cannot be ignored. While the emergency services have performed admirably, it is clear that more needs to be done in the realm of fire prevention and public awareness.
These questions need to be asked: Are residents in Singapore sufficiently informed and equipped to handle fire risks? Are older buildings adequately maintained to meet modern fire safety standards? And are fire prevention inspections and drills being carried out with enough regularity and rigour?
There is a pressing need to strengthen fire safety protocols, especially in residential buildings. This includes more frequent checks on electrical systems, better enforcement of clutter regulations in common corridors, and ensuring every household has access to basic fire-fighting equipment such as smoke detectors and extinguishers. We also urge that fire safety education be more deeply embedded in schools and community outreach programmes.
Every fire that results in injury or death is one too many. Singapore must act now to protect its people from preventable tragedies.

However, at the end of the day, these people live their lives with experiences similar to ours, albeit with a few challenges. They can be whoever they want to be – artists, thinkers, educators, athletes and so on. While their disability may influence how they navigate the world, it is not the sum of who they are.
Unfortunately, this reductive view is mirrored in how we treat sports for people with disabilities. These athletes are frequently portrayed as “inspirations” simply for existing, rather than being recognised for their skill and competitiveness.
This narrative, however well-intentioned, further “others” them. Instead, we need to shift towards genuine inclusion, where disabled athletes are given equal space, coverage and respect – not just admiration from afar.
One meaningful step would be to increase awareness of para sports in the media and schools.

Together, these efforts would help challenge the indifference that persists in society.
We must create more opportunities for people with disabilities to be seen, heard and celebrated for their abilities, not just as symbols of resilience but also as full, multifaceted individuals. By doing so, we take a step towards a more empathetic and equitable society. Integration is not charity; it is justice.
Inclusion through sport is powerful. It fosters mutual respect, encourages access, and allows future generations, disabled and non-disabled alike, to grow up with broader, richer ideas on who belongs where. And the answer should always be “Everyone, everywhere”.

"Forum: In a stormy world, Singapore must sail smarter","UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","Prime Minister Lawrence Wong’s parliamentary address on the US’ sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs rightly highlights a turning point in global trade – and for Singapore (US tariffs will significantly impact Singapore’s growth; Budget 2025 to help in short term: PM Wong, April 8).
As a small, open economy deeply dependent on the rules-based global order, we cannot afford to wait and watch.
We must reform, adapt, and lead with renewed purpose.
China describes its economy as an ocean that cannot be affected by tariff storms.
Singapore, by contrast, is a well-built smart ship: small, but brilliantly engineered – agile, precise and resilient.
We do not rely on scale to withstand turbulence. We rely on strategy, speed and the ability to adjust our sails when the winds shift.
To remain economically resilient, we must first diversify beyond traditional trade and logistics.
Investing in advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, green technology, biotechnology and digital services will place us on the front lines of global demand, making us less vulnerable to tariffs or political shocks.
Equally vital is growing our base of local enterprises.
In a digital, borderless world, companies can be born global but be built and anchored in Singapore.
With the right mix of funding, mentorship and regulatory support, we can nurture high-impact start-ups with global ambitions – while remaining a trusted hub for international entrepreneurs who choose to scale from our shores.
But to truly embed this transformation, we must begin with our young. Our schools should prepare students not just to work in digital companies, but also to build them.
Incorporating start-up labs, venture-based learning, coding and innovation projects into our curriculum can ignite entrepreneurial thinking early.
With support from industry mentors and start-up platforms, our students can move from ideas to prototypes while still in school, becoming creators, and not just consumers, of the future economy.
Large firms and government-linked companies must also play a catalytic role by spinning off innovation, co-building with small and medium-sized enterprises, and anchoring micro-clusters that drive new ecosystems of growth.
Singapore may be small – but we are the ship that does not sink. 
We can weather this storm by being a new, enterprising nation with a clear vision to be, yes, a great nation in our own way.

Forum: Customer care seems to have gone out the window,"UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","I couldn’t agree more with invest editor Tan Ooi Boon (Why poor customer service can cause businesses to fail; and Going digital should not be an excuse for poorer services, both April 6).
Unlike popular hawker stalls with long queues where the owners don’t have time for pleasantries, it’s different in the retail and service industries. With sales becoming more competitive, it’s crucial to make your customer service a cut above the rest.
But many companies seem to have stopped actively thinking and caring about service. Most of the time, customer service representatives just go by the book and have a robotic script as well as rules and guidelines they have to follow. 
I suspect sales staff are encouraged to get rid of the customer as quickly as possible so that they can cram more customers into a day and make a dollar or two more.
The mom-and-pop stores that many of us grew up with have been replaced by big companies. These companies look at their customers as numbers rather than people and do all they can to keep costs down. They assume if the price is right and supplies are in stock, people will keep shopping.
Customer service is expensive, and in most organisations the bulk of the budget goes to revenue-generating departments, not cost centres. 
These costs are why so many customer service departments are outsourced to other countries.
Making employees skilled in customer service requires talented and dedicated training and quality staff leveraging sophisticated systems and tools.

Forum: Staff of pre-school near River Valley fire were quick to help,"UPDATED APR 11, 2025, 05:00 AM","I am writing to share my experience and concerns following the recent River Valley fire incident (10-year-old girl dies after fire breaks out at River Valley Road shophouse, April 8).
That morning, my husband and I were driving our son to pre-school, just three doors down from the affected shophouse. As we approached, around 9.40am, we were alarmed to see thick black smoke billowing from the unit. We also noticed people on the window ledge, trying to escape the dense smoke.
I recorded the scene on my phone to alert someone at my son’s pre-school and urged my husband to call the fire department. Initially, we thought that the onlookers across the street – about five of them already filming – would have alerted the authorities already. But not wanting to take any chances, my husband made the call around 9.45am. To our shock, the SCDF operator he spoke with was unaware of any incident in the area and asked him for the shophouse’s address.
While my husband remained in the car with our son, I ran into the pre-school to alert the staff. No one was aware of what was happening just a few doors away. The principal quickly called the SCDF too, opened the school doors to shelter the affected children from the burning unit, and coordinated her team of teachers to provide water, first aid and a safe space.
Reflecting on the incident, I am troubled by the apparent culture of bystanders prioritising video recording over actually helping. What if my husband hadn’t called, assuming someone else had already done so?
I also want to acknowledge Cambridge Pre-school’s swift and compassionate response which was unfortunately overlooked in the news reports. All the recognition went to the foreign workers who were seen helping (who rightly deserve praise), but not the pre-school staff, who were quick to help the frightened children.
This letter is to recognise the parties who acted quickly, and also to bring up the need to re-examine our collective values in times of crisis. True help is not found in the videos we post, but in the lives we touch.

Forum: Studies show HPV vaccine less beneficial for females aged 27 to 45,"UPDATED APR 10, 2025, 05:00 AM","We thank Dr Angela Tan for her letter “Subsidise HPV vaccinations for women in late 20s to 40s” (April 4).
The Ministry of Health (MOH) extends subsidies to vaccinations recommended under the national immunisation schedules, which we regularly review in consultation with the Expert Committee on Immunisation (ECI). To ensure judicious use of public resources whilst maximising health benefits for Singaporeans, the ECI takes reference from international best practices, emerging clinical data and cost-effectiveness evaluations to determine the vaccinations to be included.
The prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is most effective when vaccination is completed before exposure to the virus. International studies have shown that the HPV vaccine is less beneficial for females aged 27 to 45 at the population level. Hence, this group has not been recommended by the ECI to receive the HPV vaccination under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule.
For women above 26, regular cervical cancer screening at the recommended intervals remains an effective preventive measure.
Under the national subsidised screening programme (currently Screen for Life), Singaporean women aged 25 to 29 can receive subsidised pap smear screening every three years, while those aged 30 and above can receive subsidised HPV testing every five years. Appointments can be made at general practitioner clinics under the Community Health Assist Scheme via go.gov.sg/screen-for-life.
We will continue to ensure that vaccines and preventive screenings remain affordable and accessible to Singaporeans.

Forum: Time for thorough review of fire safety in buildings like older shophouses,"UPDATED APR 10, 2025, 05:00 AM","The recent fire in River Valley Road, which claimed a young life and left 21 others, including children, injured, has raised critical questions about fire safety, particularly in older structures like shophouses (10-year-old girl dies after fire breaks out at River Valley Road shophouse, April 8). 
Like many, I am shocked at this incident. One would assume that, in a developed nation, established building and fire safety protocols would have proactively addressed and mitigated such risks, particularly with regard to the number of exits required for different types of buildings and occupancies.
The tragedy underscores the potential dangers inherent in properties that may have limited exit routes.  Shophouses like the one that caught fire, as they are often configured, often have only one exit route and can pose significant fire hazards.
It also highlights the urgent need for relevant authorities like the Singapore Civil Defence Force to re-examine the adequacy and enforcement of fire codes and building regulations, especially with regard to the types of spaces that are permitted to host businesses with higher human traffic, such as child-centric businesses and fitness gyms. I’ve noticed that many childcare centres, enrichment classes and gyms are housed in shophouses.
The authorities should conduct a thorough review of existing fire safety regulations and their implementation pertaining to shophouses and similar buildings. 
They must also ascertain whether current fire safety standards adequately address the unique structural characteristics of older shophouses – many of which may have been adapted over time.
Are there sufficient requirements regarding secondary escape routes and fire-resistant materials, and regular safety inspections of these types of buildings?
This review should also consider mandating upgrades to enhance fire safety, such as installing fire suppression systems or creating additional escape routes where feasible. Stricter enforcement of existing regulations and more frequent inspections are also crucial to ensure compliance.
The River Valley Road fire is a stark reminder that we cannot be complacent about fire safety. The loss of a life and the suffering of the injured demand a robust and immediate response.
The authorities, building owners and occupiers must work together to ensure that such an incident is not repeated, and that all our living and working spaces are as safe as they can be.

Forum: Spend wisely and leverage support to weather bad times,"UPDATED APR 10, 2025, 05:00 AM","Vikram Khanna’s Opinion piece “Trump tariffs’ impact on Singapore: The good news and the bad” (April 7) highlights how US trade policies may bring both short-term benefits and long-term risks for Singapore. While consumers may initially enjoy lower prices due to diverted exports from tariff-hit Asian producers, the broader economic impact, including potential job losses, slower growth and investment declines, calls for prudent financial adjustments.
In the light of these developments, Singaporean households can take measured steps to adapt without compromising their quality of life. A strategic approach to spending, such as comparing prices across platforms, timing major purchases with promotions and maximising loyalty rewards, can help families manage costs effectively.
Given the potential for economic headwinds, maintaining financial preparedness is crucial. Regularly reviewing household budgets, prioritising essential expenses, and setting aside contingency savings can provide stability amid uncertainty.
Government support schemes and community resources remain valuable safety nets, and staying informed about such assistance ensures families can access help when needed.
Beyond immediate savings, adopting sustainable consumption habits such as buying refurbished electronics or coordinating bulk buys with neighbours can yield long-term financial and environmental benefits.
Ultimately, by being adaptable, staying informed, making mindful spending choices, and leveraging available support, households can mitigate risks while maintaining financial resilience. As Mr Khanna’s analysis suggests, the road ahead may hold both bargains and challenges, and with careful planning, Singaporeans can weather these changes confidently.

"Forum: Thanks, NParks, for doing a great job","UPDATED APR 10, 2025, 05:23 AM","When I first landed on the shores of Singapore, what amazed me most was the profusion of trees and greenery everywhere. And 45 years later, I am still amazed.
One does not need to visit the Botanic Gardens or Fort Canning Park to enjoy the beautiful trees – they are everywhere. Driving on some roads, I wonder if I am driving through a forest.
The National Parks Board is doing a wonderful job of keeping these green canopies well-trimmed, watered and thriving. Here, a word of appreciation too to the foreign workforce often seen on high cranes wielding cutters and saws, trimming or tending to these majestic trees. 
Singapore is indeed a “city in a garden” and I feel proud and privileged to belong here.

Forum: Bus driver continued journey even though air-conditioning was not working,"UPDATED APR 09, 2025, 05:00 AM","I had the misfortune of boarding SBS service 121 on April 3 around 7.20pm.
It was only after it had left the bus stop that I realised there was no air-conditioning and no opening for ventilation.
When the bus driver confirmed that the air-conditioning was not working and that the service was continuing, I asked if he could open the doors for ventilation. 
He said the doors could be opened only at bus stops.  
I decided to endure the ride till it reached my destination at Tiong Bahru MRT station, given the heavy downpour and my lack of familiarity with the bus route in the dark.
With my history of asthma, I did my best and pulled out a fan to circulate the air around me.
But the lack of air circulation got to me and I had to get off at some remote stop. 
No satisfactory response came from SBS Transit following my report of the incident.  
The bus driver should have stopped as soon as possible and not allowed any boarding once the air-conditioning broke down.
SBS should take steps to prevent something like this from happening again and not just apologise for any distress or inconvenience caused.

Forum: HDB’s two suggestions don’t address persistent challenges singles face in securing flats,"UPDATED APR 09, 2025, 05:00 AM","I thank the Housing Board for its reply “More 2-room HDB flexi flats to meet demand from first-timer singles” (April 7) to my letter “No success for single applying for HDB flat after 10 tries” (April 1).
However, I would like to address two of the suggestions it offered – namely, to apply for projects with lower application rates and to consider the resale market with grants.
First, the recommendation to choose Build-To-Order (BTO) projects in areas with lower application rates, such as Jurong West or Queenstown, may sound practical, but it does not consider the constraints that many singles face.
For some of us, our livelihoods, caregiving responsibilities or access to essential services are closely tied to specific regions.
Moving to a location simply because the application rate is lower may disrupt our lives.
Furthermore, even within those developments, the number of two-room flexi units for singles is small, and the odds remain slim.
Second, the resale market is not a feasible alternative for many singles. While HDB points out that grants of up to $115,000 are available, the reality is that resale flats – especially in mature estates – are often priced two or three times more than a comparable BTO unit.
In my case, I am eligible for only one of the three grants, making the cost gap even wider.
Even with maximum subsidies, resale flats remain out of reach for singles who earn modest incomes and do not have the benefit of dual-income households.
I hope HDB can better recognise the real-life challenges that many single applicants face – financial constraints, limited options and repeated balloting disappointments – and consider refining the system. Making the process more equitable, such as by introducing priority schemes for long-time unsuccessful applicants, would be a good start.

Forum: Public safety and health of ecosystem at risk from otter population at golf course,"UPDATED APR 09, 2025, 05:00 AM","Over the past year, a golf course in Singapore’s northern region has faced growing disruptions due to the otter population there. What began as a novelty has escalated into ecological and safety concerns.
The club’s closed-pond ecosystem, once carefully managed, has been destabilised. Otters have drastically reduced populations of algae-eating fish and invertebrates, leading to uncontrolled aquatic plant overgrowth, murky water, and eroded pond edges. Several golfers have missed their step and fallen into the blurred waterlines.
The otters have encroached into high-traffic areas, including walkways, where a den has formed. They have also been observed in the swimming pool. Despite “Otter Crossing Zone” signs and educational efforts, their unpredictable behaviour poses risks, especially to children attending golf and swimming lessons.
A 2021 incident at the Botanic Gardens, where a jogger was bitten by otters, serves as a sobering precedent. Parents are justifiably concerned.
As food sources deplete, the otters may migrate, taking the problem elsewhere. Restocking ponds could invite their return, creating a vicious circle unless proactive measures – including stricter population control – are implemented.
Singapore’s “City in Nature” vision is commendable, but harmony requires pragmatism. Golf courses are recreational spaces, not wildlife reserves.
With public safety and ecosystem health at stake, a coordinated response from the authorities is urgently needed to pre-empt accidents and restore balance.

Forum: Promote a ‘play safe and report’ mindset in likely child abuse cases,"UPDATED APR 09, 2025, 05:00 AM","As a father of a five-year-old, I was saddened to read that over the last 10 years, there have been at least eight child abuse cases that were not known to social services when the child was killed (Info from Megan Khung’s pre-school gave no reason for ECDA to suspect girl’s abuse: MSF, April 8).
We have a strong culture of “Don’t cause trouble”/“Mind your own business” in Singapore, and we’re often worried about personal repercussions if we were to report our neighbours, friends or even casual acquaintances.
I believe it’s not too far-fetched to say that this culture possibly contributed to the eight deaths in some way.
We should be encouraging a “Don’t think too much, play safe and report” mindset.
And to encourage the reporting of child abuse cases, I believe the Government can do more to assure the public that such reports will remain anonymous. 
These steps might prevent such tragedies from occurring.

Forum: Don’t try to play along to outsmart a scammer,"UPDATED APR 09, 2025, 05:00 AM","I was disheartened to read the article about a woman who lost $78,000 in a job scam despite thinking she was smart enough to spot a con (‘I thought I could outwit scammers’: Woman who lost over $78,000 to job scam in four days, April 6).
Despite growing awareness campaigns and countless warnings, some continue to underestimate the psychological manipulation scammers employ. They believe that their awareness or intelligence will shield them. Some even engage scammers out of boredom or curiosity, thinking they are in control, until it’s too late. In this case, the woman lost almost all her life savings.
Scammers are armed with psychological tricks designed to exploit trust, loneliness and overconfidence. No one is immune – not the educated, not the alert, not even the tech-savvy.
The best defence isn’t to play along, probe further or test your luck. It’s to end the interaction the moment you feel something is off.
I hope more will learn that we don’t need to be cleverer than a scammer. We just need to be cautious enough to walk away.

Forum: Users should not hog weight-bearing machines at gym,"UPDATED APR 08, 2025, 05:28 AM","I exercise regularly at an ActiveSG Gym, and appreciate the various aerobic and weight-bearing machines available.
As it is a public gym, there is high footfall, and hence there is a need for users to be considerate and practise courtesy in their use of equipment.
Unfortunately, there are a few inconsiderate users who frustrate other users by hogging some of the machines. When politely asked to share the use of the machines after they have been on them for a long time, these users point to the notices pasted all over the gym stating that users should limit their workout on each machine to 30 minutes. 
Applying this 30-minute limit to every machine in the gym is hard to understand. 
I can understand a 30-minute rule for the treadmill machines, as these are aerobic machines. There are also six of such machines. 
But there is only one of each type of weight-bearing machine, to be shared by all users. Hence, someone who hogs a weight-bearing machine for 30 minutes each time deprives other users of the chance to use it.
Weight-bearing machines are not meant for such long usage, unlike aerobic machines like treadmills.
ActiveSG is probably better informed about how aerobic and weight-bearing machines should be used. I wonder if there is a need to rectify such notices in order to “ensure a positive and inclusive environment for all”.

Forum: Don’t just mourn Megan’s death but be moved enough to act next time,"UPDATED APR 08, 2025, 05:00 AM","The recent sentencing in Megan Khung’s case (Abuse, death of four-year-old girl: Mum jailed 19 years, boyfriend gets 30 years’ jail, 17 strokes, April 3) has reawakened a deep, shared sorrow. Like others, I was horrified by her abuse and death. Nineteen years in prison feels hollow when a child has lost her life in such a cruel and preventable way.
What makes this tragedy even harder to bear is knowing Megan wasn’t invisible. Her suffering didn’t go unnoticed. Concerns about her safety were raised. People noticed, cared, and tried to act.
Somewhere along the way, those red flags were raised, but somehow not followed through with the protection Megan needed.
This isn’t about blaming any one individual or organisation or pointing fingers. It’s about asking ourselves: How can we do better next time?
We must acknowledge that even when professionals raise alarms, the response isn’t always clear or coordinated.
At times, the legal system may prioritise parental rights over a child’s safety, and well-meaning individuals – teachers, social workers, family members – are left powerless.
We need a comprehensive, coordinated national approach to child protection, one that connects schools, social services and the legal system to respond to concerns swiftly and decisively.
More than that, we need a cultural shift. We can no longer treat child abuse as a private matter; we must all be willing to step up and act when we see something wrong.
Megan’s story is a wake-up call to all of us to be “upstanders”, not bystanders. Upstanders don’t just notice; they speak up, intervene, and ensure that action is taken.
When a child’s safety is at risk, we must ask ourselves: Are we willing to step in and do what it takes to protect him?
Megan’s death shouldn’t just be something we mourn. It should change us. It should move us – to reform our systems, to listen to the warnings, and to act in ways that protect our children. For her sake – and for all the children who still need us to see, to care, and to act.

Forum: Schools and communities can do more to protect the young from radical influences,"UPDATED APR 07, 2025, 05:00 AM","The recent detention of a teenage Singaporean who plotted to attack mosques is not just alarming, but also portends a deeper, more insidious problem that demands urgent action (ISD detains Singaporean teen who wanted to kill at least 100 Muslims at 5 mosques, April 2).
While security agencies intervened in time, we need to note that radicalisation does not occur in isolation. It festers in unmoderated online spaces, feeds on misinformation, and preys on those searching for identity and belonging.
Parents and caregivers must be the first line of defence, vigilant in monitoring changes in their children’s behaviour and online activities. If there are any signs of extremist leanings, parents must not hesitate to alert the authorities.
Early intervention can mean the difference between rehabilitation and devastation. Schools and communities can do more to cultivate digital literacy and critical thinking, helping young people know how to resist extremist narratives.
Singapore’s religious harmony is not a given; it is a delicate fabric that requires constant attention. A united, proactive approach – where parents, educators and society work together with security agencies – will be our strongest shield against the threat of radicalisation.

Forum: More 2-room HDB flexi flats to meet demand from first-timer singles,"UPDATED APR 07, 2025, 05:00 AM","We thank Ms Tuan Ming Lee for her feedback (No success for single applying for HDB flat after 10 tries, April 1).
We recognise that singles, like families, aspire to own their own homes. Since the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme was introduced in 1991, we have progressively enhanced public housing access for singles.
From 2013, eligible first-timer singles could buy new two-room flexi flats in non-mature estates. Since October 2024, this has been extended to all Standard, Plus and Prime projects islandwide.
Singles can also purchase resale flats and receive up to $115,000 in housing grants.
To meet increased demand from singles, we are launching a larger supply of up to 14,000 two-room flexi flats from 2024 to 2026. This is more than a 50 per cent increase from the units launched from 2021 to 2023.
Also, from the July 2025 Build-To-Order (BTO) sales exercise, the Family Care Scheme will provide singles with priority access when they apply for new flats to live with or near their parents.
While we understand Ms Tuan’s disappointment, we note that more than half of her applications were made under the Sale of Balance Flats and open booking exercises. Given the strong demand, coupled with the limited supply of these flats compared with BTO flats, these flats typically see high application rates.
Overall, demand from singles for BTO flats remains high, but application rates vary significantly across projects.
For example, Ms Tuan applied for two-room flexi flats in the previous BTO sales exercises in Bedok and Kallang/Whampoa towns, where application rates were 19.3 and 12.5, respectively.
In the same sales exercises, there were two-room flexi flats in Jurong West in October 2024 and Queenstown in February 2025, with much lower application rates of 1.7 and 4.4, respectively.
To increase their chances of securing a flat, we advise flat applicants with pressing housing needs to apply for projects with lower application rates. Applicants can view the application rates of all BTO projects on the HDB flat portal. The application rates are updated thrice daily throughout the eight-day sales exercises, to help applicants make informed decisions.
We will continue to focus on meeting the increased demand from singles to help them in their home ownership journey before contemplating further moves.

Forum: Clear standards needed for professional life coaches,"UPDATED APR 07, 2025, 05:00 AM","Recent articles in The Straits Times on life coaching in Singapore have sparked useful public debate on the value, credibility and cost of coaching services (Life coaches who help clients through heartbreak, stress and personal challenges; and Life coaching: Help, hype or hustle?, both March 29).
As a practising coach, I welcome the spotlight. But the coverage also brought out deeper issues around how coaching is understood, priced and governed in Singapore.
Psychotherapy and counselling in Singapore are guided by recognised academic qualifications and professional registration with established associations. While not governed by statutory regulations, these professions operate within well-defined standards and predictable market expectations. 
In contrast, the coaching sector here remains unregulated. Anyone can call himself a coach, and fees range widely without clear benchmarks tied to credentials or experience.  
Yet coaching, when done well, is a skilled, structured and ethically governed process. It requires proper training, professional development and ethical standards. It is not a transactional vendor service or a casual conversation over coffee.
The recent report highlighted that the average hourly rate for coaching in Singapore is about $300. This is a useful data point, but it should not obscure the fact that fees vary greatly – and without transparent, credible standards, both clients and coaches may struggle to navigate expectations.
There is a case for clearer publishing of fee ranges by credential level, public education on what professional coaching entails, and perhaps a local registry of credentialed coaches.
Ultimately, coaching is not a hustle, a hype, or an indulgence. It is a professional service that helps individuals and organisations navigate complex transitions and challenges.
It deserves to be recognised, priced and practised with the same seriousness we accord to other professional services.

PayNow QR is the designated electronic payment method for making CPF voluntary contributions, given its convenience and accuracy.
When members scan the QR code with their mobile banking apps, all required information, such as payment amount and transaction type, is automatically included, eliminating the need for manual entry.
This allows members’ voluntary contributions to be correctly credited to their CPF accounts almost instantly, making the process simple and convenient.
We understand that a minority of members may encounter issues scanning the PayNow QR with their banking app. In such cases, they can reach out to their banks for assistance.
In Mr Nah’s phone call with the board, our customer service executive provided guidance on resolving the issue, and suggested that he visit a CPF service centre if he needed more help.
We understand that Mr Nah was able to complete his voluntary CPF contribution via PayNow QR himself later that day. Following Mr Nah’s Forum letter, we also contacted him to address his feedback.
While PayNow QR remains our main electronic payment method given its convenience to members, we will continuously review our processes to enhance CPF members’ experience.
Members who need help with their transactions can contact us at cpf.gov.sg/writetous or call the CPF hotline on 1800-227-1188.

"Letter of the week: Bank wanted proof of $750,000 cash balance for retiree to retain credit card","UPDATED APR 04, 2025, 05:00 AM","Transitioning into retirement can be fraught with frustration and disappointment even if you are financially sound and have ample assets.  
My Trust Bank credit card will be terminated just because I applied for an increase in my spending limit before going on a trip to the United States recently.
Trust Bank’s app rejected my request for a spending limit increase when I indicated that I was a retiree. I then received an e-mail that was not even personally addressed to me, telling me that if I could not provide an income statement, my credit card would be terminated as I “did not meet their income criteria to qualify for an unsecured credit card”.
This was a strange request to make, three years after it issued the credit card when I had earlier qualified for it.
I am mystified by Trust Bank’s actions as I am a cardholder in good standing, always having paid on time, consistently hitting its monthly and quarterly spend targets, and making 40 to 45 transactions monthly.
I proposed that the bank do a financial analysis of my net worth, and submitted my CPF statement that showed that I have exceeded the current Enhanced Retirement Sum limit of $426,000 and would be receiving a monthly payout of over $3,000 a month for life when I turn 65 in a few months.
The bank declined, and asked if I could instead produce a bank statement that shows a cash balance of $750,000. All these onerous requirements from a digital bank that requires a $30,000 annual income to qualify for a fresh application.  
Trust Bank has offered no attempt to resolve the issue by assessing my creditworthiness holistically, but has instead adopted a blanket rejection due to my having no payslip. 
 If retirees as a group are disproportionally rejected in this way despite having substantial financial assets, then this seems to be age-based discrimination.

Forum: Subsidise HPV vaccinations for women in late 20s to 40s,"UPDATED APR 04, 2025, 05:00 AM","I am a family doctor who is very passionate about overall sexual wellness for both men and women. Recently, I was invited to speak at various International Women’s Day events focusing on women’s health. I shared about the human papillomavirus (HPV), cervical cancer prevention, sexual health, and making women’s health a priority.
I am in my 40s and believe more can be done for women in this age bracket concerning cervical cancer and HPV infection.
Cervical cancer remains the 10th most common cancer facing Singapore women and a lot more can be done.
In the course of my clinical work, I have seen many women who are exposed to pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions and most of them are in their late 20s to their late 40s.
Since cervical cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer, I hope that women in this age range can qualify for subsidised vaccinations too.
The vaccine is fully subsidised for all female Singaporeans aged between nine and 17, and partially subsidised for those aged between 18 and 26.
With HPV vaccinations and pap smears, and HPV tests, we can keep cervical cancer at bay.  We also need to do more for women who missed the national immunisation programme vaccinations. 
I hope the Government can give subsidies for HPV vaccinations for women in their late 20s to their 40s. This is the period where women are in the peak of their lives, be it career development or raising their families. 
It would be sad for them to be robbed of their fulfilling lives – when this cancer is highly preventable for older women too.

"Forum: Beyond counter-terror drills, people have a vital role to play","UPDATED APR 04, 2025, 05:00 AM","I read with concern that two more self-radicalised individuals were detained by the Internal Security Department (ISD detains Singaporean teen who wanted to kill at least 100 Muslims at 5 mosques; and S’porean girl, 15, who wanted to marry ISIS fighter, is first female teen dealt with under ISA, both April 2).
The threat of terrorist attacks caused by self-radicalisation is a reminder that even if racial and religious relations in Singapore are healthy, a handful of isolated followers from extremist and sectarian movements can have an outsized impact if they succeed in their attacks.
Extremist and sectarian forces could seek to fan the flames further and divide our country. Some troublemakers could even be well-funded state-sponsored actors.
The Ministry of Defence and the Home Team have been doing an excellent job with their counter-terrorism exercises. For example, there is the annual Exercise Heartbeat, a counter-terrorism and emergency preparedness exercise to strengthen community resilience against terrorism threats.
But beyond these operational exercises, the people also have an important part to play in the information space.

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs), including various interfaith groups, can conduct closed-door table-top exercises to simulate first responses to various scenarios of terrorism aimed at weakening social cohesion.
If such exercises are already being attended by key community leaders, these exercises can be expanded to involve more NGOs and self-help groups.
Scenarios can be based on past attacks that have happened abroad. Scenarios should also change according to how terrorists are adapting to the latest security measures.
During an exercise, NGOs and self-help group leaders can take the lead as “social first responders” in the information space, simulating and coordinating their statements and publicity materials, including both social media and mass media.

Letter of the week: Good reasons why NSmen serve with conviction,"UPDATED APR 04, 2025, 05:00 AM","I refer to the Forum letter “Could NSmen’s mental resilience be a weak link?” (March 25), and would like to share my perspectives as an NSman.
National service is sacrosanct to Singapore’s defence, given the limitations of our population and fiscal resources. Tens of thousands give their time to do their part year after year in training.
Realism in training is what NSmen expect each time because of the price we and our families pay to serve.
Every commander strives to achieve training realism, while ensuring every man returns home safely. This includes caring for the mental well-being of our soldiers.
Our commitment may not have been tested in war, like the author rightly points out, and we hope it never will.
Our commitment is built upon the challenges and struggles we face in juggling work, family and NS responsibilities.
I have seen many doing their part even in extenuating personal circumstances, and not shirking because they know someone else would have to take on their role if they were away. That sense of responsibility is the strongest link in our defence, knowing we serve together.
A large part of resilience comes from knowing why we serve. Training must be and indeed is as realistic as can be safely allowed.
If the test truly comes, what would keep us from caving in would be the clarity of conviction of who and what we are defending in the first place. Our families, our way of life and the very ones we fight alongside with – that is why we serve.

It was recommended that she visit a polyclinic doctor and seek regular treatment.
So we went to Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic.
It was heartening to witness Dr Sharon Wong attend to my wife in such a dedicated and professional manner that we were reassured the wound would heal in due time.
Dr Wong, who had a leg fracture, stooped down, felt the areas around the wound and directed us to a wound nurse with instructions.
The wound is getting better. I wish to express my sincere thanks to Dr Wong, who was so caring towards my wife.

Forum: Steps taken to ensure secure and accessible voting for overseas Singaporeans,"UPDATED APR 03, 2025, 05:00 AM","We thank Forum writers Ng Cheng Hoon and Rahul Patwardhan for their letters “Let Singaporeans vote in the elections, no matter where they are”, and “Make it easier for overseas Singaporeans to vote” (both April 1).
Ms Ng suggested that we implement online voting via a secure digital platform, such as the Singpass application, so that Singaporeans who are travelling on Polling Day can vote.
The Elections Department has previously studied this suggestion. We have not implemented online voting because it is difficult to prevent voter impersonation and ensure voter secrecy.
For voters and contesting candidates/political parties to be sure that online votes are accurately recorded, the system will need to retain information on the voter’s choice in case an audit is required. This will compromise voter secrecy. For now, voting by paper ballot remains the most transparent and secure method of voting.
Mr Patwardhan suggested that we remove the current requirement for an overseas Singaporean to have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of 30 days in the last three years before he can qualify as an overseas voter.
This is a longstanding requirement to ensure that overseas voting is extended only to Singaporeans who continue to maintain links to Singapore.
Besides the arrangement for overseas Singaporeans to be able to vote at one of the 10 overseas polling stations, we have recently introduced postal voting to improve voter access for overseas Singaporeans. This was implemented at the 2023 Presidential Election and will also be available for the upcoming general election. 
The Elections Department would also like to remind Singaporeans intending to vote from overseas in the upcoming general election to register as overseas voters early, if they have not already done so.
Applications to be registered as overseas voters will close at the end of the second day after the Writ of Election is issued. Eligible overseas Singaporeans may register as overseas voters via “voter services” on the Elections Department website.

Forum: Smart policies and political will needed to give everyone a fair shot at success,"UPDATED APR 03, 2025, 05:00 AM","The idea of “governance for equity” is all about making sure a country is run in a way that levels the playing field where everyone, regardless of background, gets a fair shot at success.
It’s not just about handouts, but about fixing any deep-rooted unfairness in the system. This means policies must be designed to lift the disadvantaged, close income gaps, and give people real opportunities through education, healthcare and fair wages.
So, how do countries actually make this happen? It takes a mix of smart policies and political will – things like letting marginalised communities have a say in decisions, taxing the rich more to fund social programmes, and making sure healthcare and education are accessible to all.
Where does Singapore stand in all this? On the plus side, we’ve done a lot right. Our public housing system keeps homes affordable for most, our healthcare and education are top-notch and heavily subsidised, and racial harmony is something we actively maintain.
The Government is efficient, corruption is low, and schemes like SkillsFuture help people stay employable. Plus, our strict policies ensure stability, which has helped Singapore grow into a prosperous nation.
But there are still gaps. Despite our wealth, income inequality remains high. The cost of living is a struggle for middle class families who don’t qualify for much aid. 
Singapore has come far in fairness and efficiency, but true equity means ensuring no one gets left behind as we grow. It’s about balancing our economic success with a stronger safety net, fairer wages, and a more inclusive society.
If we keep refining our approach, we can get closer to being a place where everyone thrives.

Forum: No success for single applying for HDB flat after 10 tries,"UPDATED APR 01, 2025, 05:00 AM","For the past three years, I have been diligently applying for a Build-To-Order (BTO) flat under the singles scheme. I have submitted at least 10 applications, yet each attempt has ended in disappointment.
While I understand that demand for public housing is high and families are prioritised, the current balloting system appears to put singles at a distinct disadvantage.
Up till recently, singles could apply for only two-room flexi flats in non-mature estates. Even with the changes made to allow singles to apply for two-room flexi flats across all types of BTO projects, the odds of securing a flat are still low, with thousands of applicants competing for these units.
To make the BTO application process more equitable for singles, the Housing Board could consider the following improvements:
- Increase the supply of two-room flexi flats
With the growing number of singles in Singapore, it is time to allocate more units to meet the demand.
- Introduce a priority scheme for repeat applicants
Just as families with young children receive additional ballot chances, singles who have applied unsuccessfully multiple times should be given some form of priority.
- Greater transparency in the balloting process
Applicants should have clearer insights into whether certain factors influence the outcome. Providing a clearer breakdown of application statistics would help manage expectations.
- Consider allowing singles to apply for three-room flats
While families will always take precedence, permitting singles to ballot for three-room flats in selected estates could provide additional pathways for home ownership.
Home ownership is a fundamental aspiration for many Singaporeans, regardless of their marital status. If the Government’s commitment to making public housing affordable and accessible includes all citizens, then the system must evolve to reflect the changing demographics and needs of our society.

Forum: Make it easier for overseas Singaporeans to vote,"UPDATED APR 01, 2025, 05:00 AM","To qualify to vote, overseas Singaporeans would need to have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of at least 30 days within a three-year period before the day they register to be an overseas voter (GE2025: Singaporeans can check names from March 28 in voter rolls based on new electoral boundaries, March 27).
Why is this so? Many Singaporean citizens live overseas, promoting the Singaporean brand by making their mark in overseas markets and society. They are no lesser citizens than those who live all or most of their lives in Singapore.
Isn’t it a simple matter of proving their citizenship through their NRIC or passport, their electoral district through a registered local contact address, and their overseas resident status through a copy of their local resident visa?
The Elections Department needs to treat overseas citizens the same as resident citizens, and not create extra and unnecessary hurdles for them to vote.

"Forum: Let Singaporeans vote in the elections, no matter where they are","UPDATED APR 01, 2025, 05:00 AM","I am writing to express a concern regarding the voting rights of Singapore citizens who are required to travel abroad for work or other commitments during a general election. 
Every citizen has the right to vote for the party he believes should lead the country. However, many of us face challenges in exercising this right due to travel obligations.
Currently, Singaporeans who reside abroad can vote at 10 Singapore overseas missions that also serve as overseas registration centres. While this is helpful, it does not address the situation for citizens who do not live overseas but happen to be abroad on Polling Day. As a result, they cannot cast their votes, leading to disenfranchisement.
In the light of this, I propose that the authorities explore more voting methods to ensure that all Singaporeans, regardless of their location, can participate in the democratic process.
One possible solution could be to enable overseas voting through the Singpass application or another secure digital platform. This would allow travelling citizens to vote remotely while maintaining the integrity and security of the election process.
I believe that implementing such a system is feasible with today’s technological advancements.
I hope the authorities can explore practical solutions that uphold the voting rights of all Singaporeans, no matter where they are.

Forum: Level the CCA playing field,"UPDATED MAR 31, 2025, 05:00 AM","Schools nurture students, providing a welcoming environment where we can grow into multi-talented and purposeful beings. Co-curricular activities (CCAs) were implemented to strengthen this purpose, but the competitive nature of the selection process seems to take a toll on students.
For sports CCAs, especially, schools prioritise students who already have skills, making it more difficult for inexperienced students to join their desired CCA.
Instead, they are asked to join non-sports clubs, which are seen to be more beginner-friendly.
I think we should have more CCA vacancies, or create two different groups – competitive and recreational – so that inexperienced students can learn from coaches and enjoy the sport too.
In this way, we can reinforce the goal of working towards a healthier nation, where more students pick up the good habit of exercising.

Forum: What’s needed is a forward-looking Parliament with highest standards for members,"UPDATED MAR 31, 2025, 05:00 AM","I agree with deputy opinion editor Bhavan Jaipragas on the need to keep our politics clean and above board (Keeping fear and loathing out of Singapore’s politics, March 27).
How other societies have become so divisive to affect families and community relations is something which we as a small nation should avoid at all costs. We may have our differences, political or otherwise, but we only have this one small nation to share with everyone.
The tone and tenor of our society must be about empathy and caring for each other. I see this on display whenever I take the train or bus for my engagements. Some see me as elderly (yes, I am pushing 70 this year) and offer me their seat, which I politely decline.
I am not the only beneficiary of such good gestures.
In the article, the writer quoted from a columnist who identified “excessive intellectual certainty as the deeper problem” in relation to the rise of political violence in America. I could not agree more.
In fact, extreme behaviour arises from those who assume themselves to be the holders of truth. We see this also among those promoting religious violence. A little doubt and scepticism help to moderate our views and hold out the potential of learning from others, as no one is perfect or knows everything. Certainly a much-needed trait in these times.
At the same time, I agree with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong that we should be mindful of what is at stake at the upcoming general election (Election is about Singaporeans recognising much is at stake in this new environment: PM Wong, March 26).
Every political party wants to gain the maximum number of seats in Parliament. Yet, in the end it’s about good governance and the kind of Parliament we all wish for Singapore.
We have seen how in other jurisdictions, unqualified individuals and those with very dubious backgrounds are in positions of power. This we must avoid.
Parliament is a serious and august institution where laws are debated and decided upon, affecting the future of Singapore. The quality of debate depends on the parliamentarians and their conviction to build a better Singapore.
As Singaporeans, we must wish for a Parliament that is forward-looking in its outlook and holds the highest standards possible for its members.

Forum: Labelling required for health and beauty supplements sold in Singapore,"UPDATED MAR 31, 2025, 05:00 AM","We thank Forum writer Huang Kangrui for the feedback (Complete ingredients list needed on health and beauty products, March 14).
The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Singapore Food Agency (SFA) oversee the regulation of health products and food products in Singapore through risk-calibrated regulatory frameworks.
For example, medicines contain potent ingredients or chemicals and are therefore subjected to more stringent controls as compared to health and beauty supplements like vitamin pills, and food supplements like juices.
Although health, beauty and food supplements do not require pre-market approval, dealers must comply with specific regulations, including appropriate labelling of their products.
Suppliers of health, beauty and food supplements must ensure that their products are labelled with the required information in English. For health and beauty supplements, this includes active ingredients, their quantities and allergens (certain colourants and preservatives). Prepackaged food products should include the ingredients, the country of origin and the name and address of the local importer.
HSA and SFA conduct random checks to ensure that products on the local market adhere to these labelling requirements.
Even with these measures in place, due to the wide diversity of these products, consumers may still come across some health, beauty and food supplements that are not adequately labelled. Consumers should exercise their judgment when considering buying these products.
Additionally, consumers who choose to buy online, especially those from overseas platforms, should exercise care as foreign sellers may sell products that are manufactured and packaged according to another country’s labelling requirements.
Consumers are encouraged to buy their health, beauty and food supplements from reliable sources, including pharmacies, reputable retailers, and those with an established retail presence in Singapore.
Consumers should also watch out for products that make medical claims about treatment or prevention of diseases and claims that are too good to be true. HSA has established a database of safe and good quality health supplements at www.hsa.gov.sg/vns-list for consumers to refer to.

Forum: Good reasons why NSmen serve with conviction,"UPDATED MAR 31, 2025, 05:00 AM","I refer to the Forum letter “Could NSmen’s mental resilience be a weak link?” (March 25), and would like to share my perspectives as an NSman.
National service is sacrosanct to Singapore’s defence, given the limitations of our population and fiscal resources. Tens of thousands give their time to do their part year after year in training.
Realism in training is what NSmen expect each time because of the price we and our families pay to serve.
Every commander strives to achieve training realism, while ensuring every man returns home safely. This includes caring for the mental well-being of our soldiers.
Our commitment may not have been tested in war, like the author rightly points out, and we hope it never will.
Our commitment is built upon the challenges and struggles we face in juggling work, family and NS responsibilities.
I have seen many doing their part even in extenuating personal circumstances, and not shirking because they know someone else would have to take on their role if they were away. That sense of responsibility is the strongest link in our defence, knowing we serve together.
A large part of resilience comes from knowing why we serve. Training must be and indeed is as realistic as can be safely allowed.
If the test truly comes, what would keep us from caving in would be the clarity of conviction of who and what we are defending in the first place. Our families, our way of life and the very ones we fight alongside with – that is why we serve.

The intention behind the mural was to create an accessible and engaging experience for those who pass by, sparking conversation and reflection within our community through our placemaking efforts. 
The intent of the mural was never to give the impression that this was the definitive timeline of Singapore’s maritime history.
Now that we know of the Singapore Maritime Heritage Interest Group, we will make sure we consult the group in future for projects on this topic.
We have plans to refresh this space with a new mural in the coming months.

Letter of the week: Preservation of heritage areas must also cater to younger generation,"UPDATED MAR 28, 2025, 05:00 AM","The Forum letter “Save traditional businesses and trades in heritage areas” (March 7) highlights a key dilemma: Which individuals and businesses get left behind in the face of progress?
When I was buying wooden clogs for a photo shoot at Chinatown Complex in 2024, the woman running the shop commented that few people buy them any more. She recalled a time when Chinatown had many clog makers. I turn 50 in 2025, and don’t recall ever seeing one. If such a business still existed, would I visit it to see how clogs are made? Yes, out of curiosity. But is it still relevant? No.
While preserving heritage businesses is important, change is both natural and necessary for society and, by extension, neighbourhoods to evolve.
While my son and nieces do visit Kampong Glam, it’s not for its fabric or carpet shops. They point to the cafes, bakeries and thrift shops that have sprouted up in the area. I can only assume these stores can afford the high rents mentioned in the letter.
Here lies the dilemma: Preservation must cater not just to Gen X and baby boomers, but also to millennials and Gen Z. If Arab Street remains focused on fabrics and haberdashery, would it become irrelevant to younger generations? And if so, how successful would preservation efforts really be?
On a recent visit, I saw fabric shop owners waiting for customers. Perhaps they are like the clog makers of the past, affected by changing trends. But unlike then, today there’s a task force supporting such heritage businesses.
Preserving heritage businesses doesn’t mean keeping them unchanged or enforcing rent control. Those that survive and thrive will be the ones that are creative and innovate their existing businesses. 
Elsewhere, in cities like Kyoto in Japan and Suzhou in China, young people and tourists rent traditional attire like the kimono and hanfu to explore heritage districts. Some call it commercialisation, but I see it as keeping culture alive.
The kebaya, now on Unesco’s intangible cultural heritage list, presents an opportunity. Some businesses are already exploring this by renting out kebayas. Perhaps our heritage businesses can consider collaborations, and the task force can help bridge the new and old.

Forum: Simple guide can help people support victims of sexual assault,"UPDATED MAR 28, 2025, 05:52 AM","I read with interest Aware’s letter “Let’s stop blaming the victim for being raped” (March 26).
The past decade has seen commendable progress in raising awareness about sexual assault and harassment. However, as a society, we still have some way to go.
In 2011, I wrote to the Forum page about being molested on a train and urged SMRT to provide a protocol so victims and bystanders would know what to do.
SMRT responded with a clear and simple protocol:
Press the emergency communication button.
Inform the train officer that you were molested.
Share the four-digit carriage number.
Wait for station officers to arrive.
Reflecting on this, I wondered: Could we create a similar protocol for the general public to guide their response when someone in their social network is harassed or assaulted?
It is already difficult for victims to speak up. Yet, friends and family _ often unintentionally _ can make it even more painful.
Unhelpful responses include: “You should have known better. You shouldn’t have done that”; and “You wouldn’t be upset if the perpetrator were rich, powerful and attractive.”
Such remarks may stem from a misguided attempt to downplay the severity of the experience, maintain social cohesion (especially when the perpetrator is known) or reassure themselves that they are safe from such attacks.
Some people also wrongly assume that unwanted sexual attention means the victim is attractive when, in reality, perpetrators often target those they believe they can exploit without consequence.
If we were to develop a straightforward guide on what people can say and do, could something like this be helpful?
Tell them it’s not their fault: “What happened to you was wrong and not your fault.”
Reinforce that they have control: “You have control over what happens next.”
Share that resources and professional help are available: “Would you like help finding support? There are hotlines, counselling services and legal aid available.”
Offer to walk with them: “Would you like me to be with you as you take your next step?”
We do not need to be trained personnel to play a role in effective support. But, just as SMRT’s protocol empowers bystanders to take action, a simple framework allows us to be part of the support system _ creating a safe space for survivors while professionals provide the care they need.
