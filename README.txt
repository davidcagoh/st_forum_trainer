# Discontinued: Straits Times Opinion Forum Writer

Originally my plan was to train a local LLM that specializes in a particular writing style.
In this case, that would've been Straits Times Forum letters, which are short and moderately varied.
My plan was to qualitatively study the language features ST Forum letters before testing Mistral-7B. 
I also built a web scraper and obtaind 46 formatted articles to explore the impact of fine-tuning.
However, Mistral-7B is way too slow on my setup, so I am putting this on hold for now.

Possible future directions include top level metrics like sentence length distributions, paragraphing,
and other ways that might enable us to cluster articles / plot a given article on the space of 
published ST forum letters. 

But since my current interest is in churning out publishable articles quickly, I'll focus on that in this season.
